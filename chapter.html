   <h1> Puberty: </h1>
  <p class="p1"> Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys.
 It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls differently. <br>Puberty is a biological process during which a person undergoes physical, sexual, and reproductive maturation. 
 It is a crucial stage of development that typically occurs during adolescence, marking the transition from childhood to adulthood. 
 <br>The onset of puberty is triggered by hormonal changes, primarily the release of sex hormones such as estrogen in females and testosterone in males.<br>
Puberty can be confusing at any age… even for parents! Although everyone has their own unique puberty timeline, boys and girls usually progress through their own sets of physical milestones,
 otherwise known as Tanner stages or sexual maturity ratings (SMRs). Learning the signs of each Tanner stage can help you better understand what your little one is going through—and better advocate for their well-being.

<h1>Changes in Girl's and Boy's body :</h1>
 <p class="p2">Tanner stage 1, when hormones are hard at work behind the scenes <br><br>
<b>Both females and males:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> 	The brain begins signaling the body to prepare for changes.</li>
  <li>The hypothalamus starts to send gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the pituitary gland.</li>
  <li>	The pituitary gland begins making luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).</li>
  <li>	There are no noticeable physical changes during stage 1
   </li>
</ul><br>
<img class="center" src="stage1.gif" style="width:50%">  <br><br><br>
<p class="p2">Tanner stage 2, when the first physical signs of puberty occur <br><br>
  <b>Females:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Breast buds start to form under the nipple. They may be tender, and they may each grow at a different rate—that's normal.</li>
      <li> The areola (the darker area surrounding the nipple) expands.</li>
        <li>	The uterus grows larger. </li>
          <li>Pubic hair begins growing on the lips of the vulva.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="p2">
    <b> Males:</b> </p>
  <ul>
	    <li>The testicles and scrotum grow larger.</li>
       <li>Pubic hair starts to grow on the base of the male genitalia.</li>
  </ul>
  <img class="center" src="stage2.gif" style="width:50%">  <br><br><br>
  <p class="p2">Tanner stage 3, the growth spurt stage<br><br>
    <b>Females:</b> 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>	A major height growth spurt begins (averaging about 3.2 inches per year).</li>
    <li>Breast buds continue to grow.</li>
      <li>	Pubic hair becomes thicker.</li>
        <li>	Hair begins forming under the armpits. </li>
          <li>	Acne may start to appear on the face and back. </li>
            <li>	Fat begins to accumulate on the hips and thighs. </li>
</ul>
  <p class="p2">
    <b>Males: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>	Height growth increases to 2-3.2 inches per year.</li>
        <li>	Themale genitalia becomes longer and the testicles continue to grow larger.</li>
          <li>	Some breast tissue may begin forming under the nipples. This happens to some males during development, but usually goes away within a couple of years.</li>
            <li>	Males begin to have nighttime ejaculations, also known as wet dreams.</li>
              <li>	The voice begins to change and may “crack” between higher and lower registers.</li>
                <li>	The muscles expand.</li>

  <h1> Adolescence:</h1>
  <p class="p1">
    Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that occurs between childhood and adulthood.
    It is typically marked by the onset of puberty and extends into the late teens or early twenties. 
    This period is characterized by significant changes in various aspects of an individual's life, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development.
    Here are some key aspects of adolescence: </p>
    <ul>  <b>  1. Physical Changes: </b>
      <br><br>
    <li>
      <b>Puberty:</b> Adolescence is often associated with the onset of puberty, during which there are significant physical changes such as the development of secondary sexual characteristics (breast development, facial hair, etc.), growth spurts, and changes in body composition.
   </li></ul>
   <ul><b>2.Cognitive Development:</b>
    <br><br>
    <li>
      <b>Abstract Thinking:</b> Adolescents begin to think more abstractly and critically. They develop the ability to understand and contemplate complex ideas and concepts.
    </li><br><li><b>Identity Formation:</b> The search for identity becomes a central focus during adolescence.
       Individuals explore different roles, values, and beliefs as they try to establish a sense of self.
    </li></ul>
    <ul><b>3.Emotional Changes:</b>
      <br><br>
    <li>
      <b>Emotional Intensity:</b> Adolescents may experience heightened emotional intensity, with mood swings and a greater range of emotions. 
    This is partly due to hormonal changes and the challenges of identity formation.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Risk-Taking Behavior:</b> There is often an increased propensity for risk-taking behavior as adolescents seek novelty, independence, and peer approval.
   </li></ul>
   <ul><b>4.Social Development:</b>
    <br><br>
    <li>
      <b>Peer Relationships:</b> Friendships and peer relationships become more important during adolescence. 
    Peer influence plays a significant role in shaping behavior and preferences.
    </li><br><li> <b>Relationships:</b> While there is a natural push for independence, family relationships continue to be important.
       There may be conflicts with parents as adolescents assert their autonomy.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul><b>5.Educational and Vocational Considerations:</b>
      <br><br>
    <li> 
    Adolescents are often making decisions about their future education and career paths during this time. This can be a period of exploration and decision-making regarding academic and vocational interests.
    </li></ul>
    <ul><b>6.Sexuality and Relationships:</b>
      <br><br>
    <li>
    Adolescence is a time of exploration and discovery regarding one's sexuality. It involves forming a deeper understanding of one's sexual orientation and preferences.
     Relationships become more complex and may involve romantic interests.
    </li></ul>
    <ul><b>7.Challenges and Opportunities:</b>
      <br><br>
    <li>
    Adolescence can be a challenging time, as individuals navigate new responsibilities, expectations, and societal pressures.
     However, it also presents opportunities for personal growth, self-discovery, and the development of skills necessary for adulthood. </li></ul>
     <p class="p1">
    It's important to note that the experiences of adolescence can vary widely among individuals.
    Factors such as culture, socioeconomic status, and individual temperament can influence how adolescents navigate this period of development.
    Additionally, the support and guidance of parents, educators, and other significant adults play a crucial role in helping adolescents navigate the challenges of growing up.
