  <h1>CHAPTER 4 ~ HEALTH </h1>
<h1> Eat healthy, Stay fit!</h1>
   <ul><p class="p1">
    <li>	A balanced diet to support overall health: </li>
    Proteins, carbohydrates, fats or lipids, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, and water are the essential components of a well-balanced diet.

   1. Carbohydrates - Carbohydrates provide you with energy, which should constitute 50- 60% of your diet. Though it forms a significant diet component, you should not treat all carbs equally.
    Sources of healthy carbs are-
    
    <li>Whole grains like Oats, Quinoa </li>
    <li>Whole wheat, Dahlia </li>
    <li>Legumes</li>
    <li> Millets like ragi, bajra, barley </li>
    <li> Vegetables</li>
   
    2. Protein - Protein helps you build muscles and develops skin and hair. It should constitute 10-12% of your diet.

    4.Vitamins - Though there are 13 essential vitamins, you should take vitamins A, C, B, and D measures.
     Sources of vitamins are -
    
     <li> Fruits </li>
      <li> Vegetables </li>
        <li> Poultry</li>
          <li> Seeds</li>
            <li> Nuts </li>
    
    5.Minerals - Minerals help release energy from the food you take and promote the growth of organs. Some essential minerals are iron, calcium, potassium, iodine, and sodium.
     Sources of minerals are -
    
     <li> Fish </li>
     <li> Meat </li>

   <li> Beans </li>
   <li> Whole grains </li>
   <li> Nuts & seeds </li>
   7. Water - You should take at least eight glasses of water as it hydrates your body and is used in body functions.
  
      <li>	<b> Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D for bone health: </b></li>
      CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D BENEFITS
<br>
Good nutrition is important at all ages to keep the bones healthy.
<br>
●Taking calcium reduces bone loss and decreases the risk of fracturing the vertebrae (the bones that surround the spinal cord).
<br>
●Consuming calcium during childhood (eg, in milk) can lead to higher bone mass in adulthood. This increase in bone density can reduce the risk of fractures later in life.
<br>
●Calcium may also have benefits in other body systems by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
<br>
●Calcium and vitamin D supplements may help prevent tooth loss in older adults.
<br>

 <b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CALCIUM </b>
<br>
General recommendations — <br> Premenopausal females (people who still get a monthly period), as well as males of all ages, should consume at least 1000 mg of calcium each day. Postmenopausal females (those who have been through menopause and no longer get a period) should consume 1200 mg of calcium a day. The total daily calcium intake includes calcium from the foods you eat plus any supplements you take.

<br>You should not consume more than 2000 mg of calcium per day (total from diet plus supplements) due to the risk of side effects.
<br>
Calcium in the diet — The primary sources of calcium in the diet include milk and other dairy products, such as hard cheese, cottage cheese, or yogurt, as well as green vegetables, such as kale and broccoli (table 1). Some cereals, soy products, and fruit juices are fortified with calcium.
<br>
Calcium supplements — The body is able to absorb calcium contained in supplements as well as from dietary sources. If it is difficult to get enough calcium from dietary sources, your health care provider can help determine the best type, dose, and timing of calcium supplements. The table shows the calcium and vitamin D content in commonly available supplements (table 2).
<br><br>
Calcium supplements come in different forms and doses:
<br>
●Calcium carbonate is effective and is the least expensive form of calcium. It is best absorbed with a low-iron meal (such as breakfast). Calcium carbonate may not be absorbed well in people who also take a specific medication for gastroesophageal reflux (called a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker), which blocks stomach acid. (See "Patient education: Gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)".)
<br>
●Many natural calcium carbonate preparations such as oyster shells or bone meal contain some lead. Children should not take these supplements.
<br>
●Calcium citrate is well absorbed in the fasting state as well as with a meal.
<br>
●Calcium doses above 500 mg are not absorbed as well as smaller doses, so large doses of supplements should be taken in divided doses (eg, a smaller dose in the morning and evening).
<br>
●Calcium supplements do not replace other osteoporosis treatments such as bisphosphonates (eg, risedronate [sample brand name: Actonel], alendronate [brand name: Fosamax]), and raloxifene (brand name: Evista).
<br>
Calcium and vitamin D supplements alone are usually insufficient to prevent age-related bone loss, although they may be beneficial in some people (older adults, those with very low intake). In most people with or at risk for osteoporosis, the addition of medication is necessary to slow the breakdown and removal of bone (ie, resorption). (See "Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)".)
<br>
Underlying gastrointestinal diseases — People who do not adequately absorb nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract (due to malabsorption) may require more than 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day. In such cases, a health care provider can help to determine the optimal dose of calcium.
<br>
Medications — Your health care provider will review all of your medications to check for possible interactions with calcium. Calcium supplements interfere with the absorption of iron and thyroid hormone, so these medications should be taken at different times.
<br>
Certain medications change the amount of calcium that is absorbed and/or excreted. As an example, loop diuretics (eg, furosemide [sample brand name: Lasix]) increase the amount of calcium excreted in the urine. On the other hand, thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) can reduce levels of calcium in the urine, potentially reducing the risk of bone loss and kidney stones. If you start taking a medication that alters how the body handles calcium, your provider may recommend a change in the amount of calcium that you consume daily. (See 'Kidney stones' below.)
<br>
Side effects of calcium — Calcium is usually easily tolerated when it is taken in divided doses several times per day. Some people do experience side effects, including constipation and indigestion.
<br>
Kidney stones — There is no evidence that consuming large amounts of calcium (from foods and drinks) increases the risk of kidney stones, or that avoiding dietary calcium decreases the risk. In fact, avoiding dairy products is likely to increase the risk of kidney stones.
<br>
However, use of calcium supplements may increase the risk of kidney stones in susceptible individuals by raising the level of calcium in the urine. This is particularly true if the supplement is taken between meals or at bedtime, and this is one of the reasons it is better to get most of your daily calcium requirement through your diet. (See "Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)".)
<br>
<b> IMPORTANCE OF VITAMIN D </b>
<br>
Vitamin D decreases bone loss and lowers the risk of fracture, especially in older adults. Along with calcium, vitamin D also helps to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Adequate vitamin D is needed for efficient calcium absorption. Vitamin D is normally made in the skin after exposure to sunlight. (See "Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)".)
<br>
Recommendations for vitamin D — Getting adequate vitamin D is important for bone health in everyone. Experts recommend that males over 70 years of age and postmenopausal females consume at least 800 international units (20 micrograms) of vitamin D per day. Lower amounts of vitamin D intake may not be adequate, while very high doses can be toxic, especially if taken for long periods of time. Although the optimal intake has not been clearly established in premenopausal females or in younger males with osteoporosis, 600 international units (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily is generally suggested.
<br>
Vitamin D is available as an individual supplement and is included in most multivitamins and some calcium supplements  (table 2). Milk is a relatively good dietary source of vitamin D, with approximately 100 international units (2.5 micrograms) per cup (240 mL), and salmon has 800 to 1000 international units (20 to 25 micrograms) of vitamin D per serving (table 3).
<br>
Most healthy people don't need to check with their health care provider before taking standard doses of a vitamin D supplement. If you are not being treated for vitamin D deficiency, you probably don't need monitoring of your vitamin D level. However, recommendations for vitamin D supplementation may be different in people with certain underlying medical conditions, such as sarcoidosis or lymphoma. In these situations, a provider will determine if supplements are needed; if so, the person's vitamin D and calcium levels should be monitored with regular tests.
 <br>      
<li>	Iron-rich foods to prevent anemia:</li>
Foods for Anaemia <br>
Most anaemic patients are advised to take 150 to 200 milligrams of iron every day. Make sure to have these foods to fight anaemia:
<br>
<b>1) Fruits and Vegetables </b><br>
Curly kale and other varieties<br>
Collard greens<br>
Pomegranates<br>
Swiss chard <br>
Red and yellow peppers<br>
Watercress<br>
Spinach<br>
Dandelion greens <br>
Oranges <br>
Strawberries <br>
Lemon <br>
Key lime <br>
Sweet potatoes <br>
Beet greens <br>
Dark leafy greens like spinach are a great source of non-heme iron. Vitamin C from citrus fruits helps the stomach to absorb iron. Swiss chard and Collard greens are good sources of both Vitamin C and iron.
<br>
<b>2) Nuts and Seeds</b><br>
Cashews<br>
Hemp seeds <br>
Sunflower seeds <br>
Pumpkin seeds <br>
Pistachios<br>
Pine nuts <br>
Walnuts <br>
Peanuts <br>
Almonds <br>
Hazelnut <br>
Nuts and seeds are some of the most nutrient-dense foods. One ounce of pistachios can provide 6.1% of the required daily value of iron in a person. <br>

 <b>3) Meat and Fish</b><br>
Lamb <br>
Liver <br>
Oysters <br>
Salmon <br>
Perch <br>
Beef <br>
Venison <br>
Shellfish <br>
Shrimp <br>
Tuna <br>
Halibut <br>
Haddock <br>
Chicken <br>
Meat and fish have heme iron. Lean cut white meat like chicken is a great source of heme protein. Three ounces of grilled chicken with sides of broccoli, sauteed spinach, and tomatoes can make for a great iron-rich meal for people suffering from anaemia.
<br>
4) Eggs <br>
Eggs are known for their proteins, but they also pack a high level of iron. Eggs can be had paired with whole-grain toast, lightly roasted tomatoes, and quinoa for breakfast that will provide a great start to the day.
<br>
 <b>5) Beans and Pulses </b> <br>
Chickpeas<br>
Black-eyed peas <br>
Black beans <br>
Lima beans <br>
Kidney beans <br>
Soybeans <br>
Lentils are supposed to be a superfood for anaemic patients. Half a cup of lentils has about 3.3 milligrams of iron, which is around 20% of what your body needs throughout the day. Beans and pulses work for both vegetarians and meat-eaters and provide a good amount of iron.
<br>
 <b>6) Blackstrap Molasses </b><br>
Blackstrap molasses are loaded with iron. They are a total nutritional powerhouse because of calcium, Vitamin B6, selenium, and magnesium. They are perfect for anaemic patients because apart from providing the iron they desperately need, blackstrap molasses also keep them healthy due to the presence of other integral nutrients.
<br>

<b>7) Grains </b><br>
Iron-fortified pasta, cereals, and grains are good options for getting the much-needed iron. However, there are natural options too. They are all rich in iron and can help in shooting up the haemoglobin level in blood.
<br>
Quinoa<br>
Oats<br>
Whole wheat<br>
Kamut<br>
Teff<br>
 <b>8) Fortified Food </b><br>
There are different types of food that are fortified with iron. You can add these to your diet if you are a vegetarian or cannot keep down other sources of iron.
<br>
Fortified, ready-to-eat cereals<br>
Fortified pasta <br>
Fortified white rice <br>
Fortified orange juice <br>
Foods made from fortified white flour, like bread <br>
Foods made from fortified cornmeal <br>

          <li>	Proper hydration: </li>

          Even some caffeinated drinks (for example, coffee, tea, and soda) can contribute a little to your daily water intake. A moderate amount of caffeine (400 milligrams) isn’t harmful for most people. Here are the caffeine amounts found in popular drinks:
            <br>
          12 ounces of soda: 30 to 50 milligrams <br>
          8 ounces of green or black tea: 30 to 50 milligrams <br>
          8 ounces black coffee: 80 to 100 milligrams <br>
          8-ounce energy drink: 45 to 80 milligrams <br>
          However, it’s best to limit caffeinated drinks. Caffeine will cause you to urinate more frequently. This can make it difficult to stay hydrated. It can also make you feel anxious or jittery.
          <br>
          Sports drinks can be helpful if you’re planning on exercising at higher-than-normal levels for more than an hour. They contain carbohydrates and electrolytes that can increase your energy. They help your body absorb water. However, some sports drinks are high in calories from added sugar. They also may contain high levels of sodium (salt). Check the serving size on the label. One bottle usually contains more than one serving. Some sports drinks contain caffeine, too. Remember that a safe amount of caffeine to consume each day is no more than 400 milligrams.
          <br>
          Energy drinks are not the same as sports drinks. Energy drinks usually contain large amounts of caffeine. Also, they contain ingredients that overstimulate you (guarana, ginseng, or taurine). These are things your body doesn’t need. Most of these drinks are also high in added sugar. According to doctors, children and teens should not have energy drinks. Because these drinks have high amounts of caffeine, they do not offer good hydration.
          <br>
          If staying hydrated is difficult for you, here are some tips that can help:
            <br>
          Keep a bottle of water with you during the day. To reduce your costs, carry a reusable water bottle and fill it with tap water.
          If you don’t like the taste of plain water, try adding a slice of lemon or lime to your drink.
          Drink water before, during, and after a workout. <br>
          When you’re feeling hungry, drink water. Thirst is often confused with hunger. True hunger will not be satisfied by drinking water. Drinking water may also contribute to a healthy weight-loss plan. Some research suggests that drinking water can help you feel full.
          If you have trouble remembering to drink water, drink on a schedule. For example, drink water when you wake up, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and when you go to bed. Or drink a small glass of water at the beginning of each hour.
          Drink water when you go to a restaurant. It will keep you hydrated, and it’s free.
