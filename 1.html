  <h1>CHAPTER 4 ~ HEALTH </h1>

               <h1>Reproductive Health </h1>
               <ul><p class="p1">
                 <li>	<b>Pregnancy care </b></li> 
                 A healthy pregnancy is one of the best ways to promote a healthy birth. Early and regular prenatal care can help prevent complications and educate women about things they can do to have a healthy pregnancy. Here are a few areas to consider:
             <br>
             Prenatal care
             Women who suspect they may be pregnant should schedule a visit to their health care provider to begin prenatal care. These visits usually include a physical exam, weight checks, and providing a urine sample. Health care providers may also perform blood tests and imaging tests, such as ultrasound exams. Prenatal visits also include discussions about the mother's health, the fetus's health, and any questions about the pregnancy.
             <br>
             Healthy diet and exercise
             With regular prenatal care, women can reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. This is done in part through following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise as advised by a health care provider, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding potentially harmful substances, such as lead and radiation.
             <br>
             Avoid alcohol and tobacco smoke
             Women can also reduce the risk of complications to the fetus and infant. Tobacco smoke and alcohol, for example, may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or the unexplained death of an infant younger than 1 year old. Alcohol use increases the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can cause a variety of problems including birth defects and intellectual disabilities.
             <br>
             Prenatal vitamins
             To promote a healthy pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend taking daily prenatal vitamins that contain 400 micrograms of folic acid. The vitamin folic acid is shown to reduce the risk for birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord by 70%. These defects, called neural tube defects, develop in the first month of pregnancy, often before a woman knows that she is pregnant. 
             Prenatal vitamins contain other vitamins that pregnant women and their developing fetus need, too
                   <li><b>	Contraception options</b></li>
                   Types of hormonal birth control methods include:
             
             Birth control pills: These may contain both estrogen and progestin, or only progestin.<br>
             Implants: These are small rods implanted beneath the skin. They release a continuous dose of hormone to prevent ovulation.
             Progestin injections, such as Depo-Provera, that are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks once every 3 months.
             The skin patch, such as Ortho Evra, is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or other place on the body. It releases a continuous dose of hormones.
             The vaginal ring, such as NuvaRing, is a flexible ring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide. It is placed into the vagina. It releases the hormones progestin and estrogen.
             Emergency (or "morning after") contraception: This medicine can be bought without a prescription at your drugstore.
                     <li>	<b>Family planning </b></li>
                     Birth spacing and postpartum family planning
             Family planning is about deciding how many children you choose to have and when you want to have them (timing of pregnancies and birth spacing). The recommended interval before attempting the next pregnancy is at least 24 months in order to reduce risks to the mother and infant. A woman can become pregnant within several weeks after birth if she has sexual relations and if she is not breastfeeding exclusively. It is important that as a health worker you discuss the importance of family planning and birth spacing, and help couples in choosing the contraceptive method that is right for them.
             <br>
             The role of family planning counselling is to support a woman and her partner in choosing the method of family planning that best suits them and to support them in solving any problems that may arise with the selected method. During late pregnancy, after giving birth and after an abortion, it is important that the woman or the couple receives and discusses correct and appropriate information so that they can choose a method which best meets their needs. If a woman, preferably with her partner, is able to make an informed choice, she is more likely to be satisfied with the method chosen and continue its use.
             <br>
             <b>THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF BIRTH SPACING AND FAMILY PLANNING </b><br>
             <li>Delaying having children can give people the opportunity to complete education or further studies. </li>
             <li>Waiting to become pregnant at least 24 months after birth can lead to health benefits for the mother and baby.</li>
             <li>Spacing births allows the mother to recover physically and emotionally before she gets pregnant again, and faces the demands of pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding.</li>
             <li>Limiting the number of children in a family means more resources for each child and more time for the parents to dedicate to each child.</li>
             <li>Family planning can also help couples in a sexual relationship not to be worried about the woman getting pregnant.</li>
             <li>STIs including HIV/AIDS can also be prevented with correct and consistent use of condoms.</li>
             <li>Younger women (adolescents) can delay pregnancy until their bodies are mature and they are ready in terms of their life course.</li>
             <li>Older women (over 35) can prevent unwanted pregnancies that are often risky for their health and can lead to complications for both mothers and infants.</li>
                       <li>	Preconception care</li>
                       Preconception health care is the medical care a person receives from their doctor or other health professionals that focuses on the parts of health that have been shown to increase the chance of having a healthy baby.
             <br>
                       Preconception health care is different for every person, depending on their unique needs. Based on a person’s health, the doctor or other health care professional will suggest a course of treatment or follow-up care as needed. Ask your healthcare provider about preconception health care, especially if you plan to become pregnant
                       Preconception health is important for every woman―not just those planning a pregnancy. It means taking control and choosing healthy habits. It means living well, being healthy, and feeling good about your life. Preconception health is about planning for the future and taking steps to get there!
