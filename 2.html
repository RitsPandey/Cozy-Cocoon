  <h1>CHAPTER 4 ~ HEALTH </h1>

<h1>  Mental Health</h1>
   <ul><p class="p1">
    <li>	<b>Stress management techniques.</b></li>

    A stronger immune system. Stress weakens the immune system and makes you more vulnerable to illness. Relaxation and stress reduction help strengthen your natural defenses.
    It is easier to maintain a healthy weight. Stress can cause us to eat or drastically reduce our appetite. And it doesn’t usually have us reaching for the salad. Instead, we go for junk food loaded with sugar, saturated fat, and salt. This reaction to stress can cause weight gain. But reducing your stress levels can help control your appetite and cravings.
    Better sleep. Stress makes it difficult to sleep due to the excess adrenaline it releases into the bloodstream, causing muscle tension. Stress management can increase endorphins, which help with muscle relaxation and promote sleep.
    Improved mood and relationships. Stress can cause you to be moody and irritable. These attitude changes affect the way you react to those nearest to you. As a result, it can put a strain on your relationships. Reducing your stress levels can help restore balance.
      <li>	<b>Seeking support for mental health concerns:</b></li>
      It can be challenging to determine whether you are experiencing a natural response to a stressful event or dealing with a more serious mental health issue. Only a professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or licensed professional counselor can accurately evaluate your mental well-being and suggest a plan for treatment if necessary.
<br>
      However, there are some signs to look out for when assessing your own mental health and deciding if professional help is necessary:
      <br>
     <li> A prolonged feeling of sadness</li>
      <li> Loss of interest in social activities</li>
        <li> Changes in sleeping or eating patterns</li>
          <li>Increased drug or alcohol use</li>
            <li>Auditory or visual hallucinations</li>
              <li>Extreme emotional highs and lows</li>
                <li>Thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
                  <li>Paranoia</li>
                    <li>Fatigue or lack of energy not related to physical health conditions</li>
                      <li>Weight gain or loss unattributed to another condition</li>
                If you experience one or more of these symptoms, take action. “The time to seek help would be when your daily functioning is impacted in a negative way,” says Kaur. “For example, this could be leaving your home, going to work, driving or any part of your daily routine. The difference between sadness and depression is loss of hope or safety. If the sadness is taking over your life for more than a month following an upsetting event, you should seek professional help.”
        <br>
      <li><b>	The connection between mental and physical well-being:</b></li>
      Mental and physical health is fundamentally linked. There are multiple associations between mental health and chronic physical conditions that significantly impact people’s quality of life, demands on health care and other publicly funded services, and generate consequences to society.  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines: health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.   The WHO states that “there is no health without mental health.”1
      Nowhere is the relationship between mental and physical health more evident than in the area of chronic conditions. The associations between mental and physical health are:
      <br>
      <li>Poor mental health is a risk factor for chronic physical conditions.</li>
        <li>People with serious mental health conditions are at high risk of experiencing chronic physical conditions.</li>
          <li>People with chronic physical conditions are at risk of developing poor mental health.</li>
            <li>The social determinants of health impact both chronic physical conditions and mental health.</li>
       Key aspects of prevention include increasing physical activity, access to nutritious foods, ensuring adequate income and fostering social inclusion and social support. This creates opportunities to enhance protective factors and reduce risk factors related to aspects of mental and physical health.
         
       <li><b>	Adequate sleep and its impact on mental health: </b></li>
       Brain activity fluctuates during sleep, increasing and decreasing during different sleep stages that make up the sleep cycle. Each stage plays a role in brain health, allowing activity in different parts of the brain to ramp up or down and enabling better thinking, learning, and memory. Research has also uncovered that brain activity during sleep has profound effects on emotional and mental health.
<br>
Sufficient sleep, especially rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, facilitates the brain’s processing of emotional information. During sleep, the brain works to evaluate and remember thoughts and memories, and it appears that a lack of sleep is especially harmful to the consolidation of positive emotional content.
 This can influence mood and emotional reactivity and is tied to mental health disorders and their severity, including the risk of suicidal ideas or behaviors.<br>
Sleeping poorly increases the risk of having poor mental health. In the same way that healthy diet and exercise can help to improve our mental health, so can sleep. <br>
There is no universal answer to the question of how much sleep a person needs. This varies from person to person. What is important is that people find out how much sleep they need and ensure that they achieve this.
The consequences of poor sleep should be taken seriously in healthcare, education, family life, and society at large.<br>
We recommend that:
<br>
The importance and benefits of sleep for both mental and physical health should be highlighted in national and local public health campaigns, including in schools and workplaces. New and easily accessible resources should be made available advising people on what they can do themselves to improve their sleep.
The Royal College of GPs should provide up to date, evidence-based training and information for its members on the importance and benefits of sleep for physical and mental health. GPs should also have access to a diagnostic tool for use in recognising sleep problems in primary care settings.<br>
The new Public Health Outcomes Framework should include a specific outcome on reducing sleep problems across the whole population. Sleep should also be reflected in new national mental health outcome indicators, including improving sleep for people who experience significant sleep problems requiring specialist help.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) should develop guidance for the management of insomnia using non-pharmacological therapies, to complement existing guidance on using pharmacological therapies. <br>
People with sleep problems should be recognised within the Improving Access to Pyschological Therapies (IAPT) programme, especially regarding access to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). IAPT staff should be suitably trained on sleep issues.
Further research should be carried out to establish the effectiveness of low cost, non-intrusive CBT-based interventions for sleep problems, such as self-help books and online courses,
