    <li>	Balanced diet for women</li>
    Here are a few healthy eating tips for women: <br>
1: Iron-rich foods <br>
The amount of blood present in your body depends on iron levels. Iron helps to form haemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. Iron is essential for everyone, but the amount needed is different for women in every phase of life. Because of loss of blood during menstruation, pregnancy, and delivery; women require the double amount of blood as men. Low levels of iron may cause iron-deficiency anaemia. Here are a few tips to get enough iron from your diet-
<br>
Consume vitamin C-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits such as lemon. <br>
Eat lean red meat.<br>
Eat seafood and poultry food. <br>
Avoid coffee, tea, or milk during meals. <br>
The daily requirement of iron–18 mg/day for an adult woman and 27 mg/day if pregnant. <br>
2: Folate or vitamin B9 during reproductive age <br>
Folate or vitamin B9 is essential during childbearing age. It decreases the risk of birth defects when taken before conception and during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Folate can also reduce the risk of getting certain types of cancer and helps to produce estrogen after menopause.
<br>
Foods to get folate or vitamin B9 are as follows: <br>

Legumes–lentils, peas <br>
Dark green leafy vegetables–spinach, kale<br>
Citrus fruits–oranges, grapefruits<br>
Nuts and seeds–walnut, almonds, flax seeds <br>
Fortified grains <br>
Avoid alcohol, nicotine. <br>
The daily requirement of folate–400 mcg/day <br>
3: Calcium for strong bones <br>
For healthy bones and teeth, we need to eat calcium-rich foods every day. Calcium also helps to regulate the heart’s normal rhythm and normal functioning of the nervous system. If you don’t get enough calcium, your bone will weaken, and this may lead to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis condition is more common in women than in men. Also, calcium deficiency can lead to irritability, weakness, fragile bones, etc. Some tips for more calcium consumption-
Include more dairy products in your diet–milk, yoghurt, cheese.<br>
Consume a lot of green leafy vegetables.<br>
Eat nuts and seeds–almonds, sesame seeds. <br>
Eat more seafood–fish, oysters. <br>
Try to replace some meat items with tofu or tempeh. <br>
Reduce the intake of caffeine, alcohol <br>
The daily requirement of calcium–1000–1200 mg/day   <br>
Everyone should be taught about the five healthy groups i.e., Grains, proteins, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. Food items with different colors, textures and tastes, both fresh and cooked should be included at every meal and for snacks. The healthiest and the cheapest drink is nothing else but clean water.
<br>

4: Vitamin D and magnesium-rich foods  <br>
For healthy absorption of calcium, you need to take vitamin D and magnesium along with calcium. Without magnesium and vitamin D, the body is unable to metabolise and use calcium. Here are some sources of vitamin D and magnesium –
<br>
Vitamin D–you can get the required amount of vitamin D from direct sunlight and foods such as fish, cod, milk, yoghurt, and fortified foods.<br>
The daily requirement of vitamin D–600 IU/day<br>
Magnesium–eat green leafy vegetables, broccoli, summer squash, and a variety of seeds.<br>
The daily requirement of magnesium–320-400 mg/day<br>
      
<li><b>	Nutritional needs during different life stages </b></li>

      There are some phases of life where they need to prioritize healthy diet:
        <br>
     <b> 1: Daily, healthy eating tips for menstruating women – </b> <br>
      
      Eat foods rich in iron and zinc–leafy vegetables, eggs, meat, nuts, and seeds <br>
      Increase your calcium intake–dairy products, milk, yoghurt<br>
      Take vitamin supplements if needed<br>
      Add omega-3 fatty acids in your diet such as fish, cod to relieve menstrual cramps<br>
      Cut down the excess intake of salt to avoid bloating <br>
      Avoid fats, bakery products, and sugar<br>
      Cut out alcohol and caffeine<br>
      2: Healthy eating for pregnant and breastfeeding women <br>
      
       During pregnancy and breastfeeding, a woman needs 300 extra calories than normal women. Because of the increased requirement, you need to focus more on a healthy diet.
      Eat all kinds of nutritional foods–rich in iron, calcium, vitamins, minerals, etc.<br>
Consume a lot of omega-3 fatty acids–fish<br>
Eat high-quality proteins–from fish, poultry foods<br>
Avoid alcohol consumption<br>
Cut down caffeine and nicotine<br>
Eat smaller and frequent meals<br>
 <b>3: Diet tips to ease the menopausal symptoms </b><br>

Boost calcium intake<br>
Eat more fats–such as omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids. They help to balance hormones and reduce hot flushes.<br>
Eat flax seeds–Flax seeds contain lignans that help to balance hormones and treat hot flushes.<br>
Consume more soy–they are useful in managing menopausal symptoms. You can try soy nuts, soy milk, and tofu.<br>
It is important to understand that women’s nutrition requirement differs from that of men. Include food items in your diet that not only boost your energy levels but also keeps you healthy to perform better at each stage of your life.
<br><br>
<li>	Importance of regular exercise and its impact on health</li>
<b>1. Exercise controls weight</b><br>
Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off lost weight. When you take part in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
<br>
Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.
<br>
 <b>2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases</b><br>
Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of heart and blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.
<br>
Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including:
<br>
Stroke.<br>
Metabolic syndrome.<br>
High blood pressure.<br>
Type 2 diabetes.<br>
Depression.<br>
Anxiety.<br>
Many types of cancer.<br>
Arthritis.<br>
Falls.<br>
It also can help improve cognitive function and helps lower the risk of death from all causes.<br>

<b>3. Exercise improves mood </b><br>
Need an emotional lift? Or need to lower stress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates many brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious.
<br>
You also may feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.
<br>
<b>4. Exercise boosts energy </b><br>
Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
<br>
Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.
<br>
 <b>5. Exercise promotes better sleep</b><br>
Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.
<br>
<b>6. Exercise puts the spark back into your sex life </b><br>
Do you feel too tired or too out of shape to enjoy physical intimacy? Regular physical activity can improve energy levels and give you more confidence about your physical appearance, which may boost your sex life.
<br>
But there's even more to it than that. Regular physical activity may enhance arousal for women. And men who exercise regularly are less likely to have problems with erectile dysfunction than are men who don't exercise.
<br>
 <b> Exercise can be fun — and social! </b><br>
Exercise and physical activity can be fun. They give you a chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply do activities that make you happy. Physical activity also can help you connect with family or friends in a fun social setting.
<br>
So take a dance class, hit the hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical activity you enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something with friends or family.
