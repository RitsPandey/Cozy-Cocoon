    <li><b>	Proper menstrual hygiene practices: </b></li> 
     Good menstrual health and hygiene practices can prevent infections, reduce odors, and help you stay comfortable during your period.
    You can choose many types of menstrual products to absorb or collect blood during your period, including sanitary pads, tampons, menstrual cups, menstrual discs, and period underwear. <br>
    Follow these tips when you are using menstrual products, in addition to instructions that come with the product: <br>
    <b>Menstrual products : </b> Wash your hands before and after using the restroom and before using a menstrual product.<br>
    Discard used disposable menstrual products properly: wrap them with toilet paper, a tissue, or other material and then toss in a trash bin. 
    Do not flush menstrual products down the toilet.<br>
    <b>Sanitary pads: </b> sanitary pads every few hours, no matter how light the flow. Change them more frequently if your period is heavy.<br>
    Tampons: Change tampons every 4 to 8 hours. Do not wear a single tampon for more than 8 hours at a time.<br>
    Use the lowest-absorbency tampon needed. If you can wear one tampon for up to 8 hours without changing, the absorbency may be too high.<br>
    <b>Menstrual cups: </b> cups every day after use. Sanitize menstrual cups after your period is over by rinsing them thoroughly and then placing them in boiling water for one to two minutes.<br>
    <b>Period underwear: </b> Most reusable period underwear is machine washable. Follow product directions on the best way to clean.
    <br><br>
    <li><b>	Use and disposal of menstrual products : </b></li>
    When it comes to handling a used sanitary pad, things can get quite messy, but things shouldn’t actually get messy if you do it the right way. On an individual level, not only can your pad attract pesky flies with its smell, but the exposed menstrual blood can also harbor a breeding ground for all sorts of unholy germs. If you have a nosy pet, or a curious child at your house, you wouldn’t want them poking around in the trash and pulling out the pads. Even though periods are a result of a natural process everybody is taught to embrace, nobody wants to open their or somebody else’s bin (we’re talking about sanitation workers) and be greeted with menstrual blood. But it's not just a matter of personal comfort and convenience. The only way to safely dispose of sanitary pads is to incinerate them or expose them to severe heat to kill the germs and pathogens thriving on the pad. Now you wouldn’t microwave your pad, would you? And to top it all off, people throw away their open pads along with their household waste. This should be a mortal sin. Now, let's take a moment to think about the effort it takes to manually separate these pads from other waste for safe disposal. So, what's the move? What is the best way to dispose sanitary pads? For starters, we can wrap the pads up in a newspaper to make it easier for everyone involved. When sanitary pads aren't disposed of properly, it exposes sanitation workers and waste pickers to harmful germs that can cause illness and disease.
     By taking the small step of wrapping them up, we can make things safer and easier for everyone involved. You’re Disposing Your Sanitary Pad Wrong!
    <li>	Understanding the menstrual cycle and its variations:</li>
    We found menstrual cycle length and variability differed considerably across the reproductive lifespan, from under 20 to above 50 years old. People under 20 years old had menstrual cycles 30.3 days long on average, 1.6 days longer than the 28.7-day average for those 35 to 39 years old. People 40 to 44 and 45 to 49 years old had shorter cycles, averaging 28.2 and 28.4 days, respectively. 
    Those over 50 years old had longer cycles, averaging 30.8 days.
    For instance, for people under 20 years old, menstrual cycle lengths varied by an average of 5.3 days. People ages 35 to 39 had the smallest variation, averaging 3.8 days. After age 40, cycles tended to vary more, ranging from 4-11 days on average. People who were above 50 years old had cycles that varied by an average of 11.2 days.  
      <li><b>	Managing menstrual pain and discomfort:</b></li>
      Besides getting enough sleep and rest, things you might want to try include:
<br>
      Exercise regularly&#8594;Physical activity, including sex, helps ease menstrual cramps for some women. <br>
      Use heat&#8594; Soaking in a hot bath or using a heating pad, hot water bottle or heat patch on your lower abdomen might ease menstrual cramps.  <br>
      Try dietary supplements&#8594; A number of studies have indicated that vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1 (thiamin), vitamin B-6 and magnesium supplements might reduce menstrual cramps.  <br>
      Reduce stress&#8594; Psychological stress might increase your risk of menstrual cramps and their severity. <br>
