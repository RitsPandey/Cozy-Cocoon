    <li><b>	Breast self-examination: </b></li>
    A breast self-exam is something a woman does at home to look for changes or problems in the breast tissue. Many women feel that doing this is important to their health.
<br>
However, experts do not agree about the benefits of breast self-exams in finding breast cancer or saving lives. Talk to your health care provider about whether breast self-exams are right for you.
<br>
The best time to do a monthly breast self-exam is about 3 to 5 days after your period starts. Do it at the same time every month. Your breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time in your monthly cycle.
<br>
If you have gone through menopause, do your exam on the same day every month.
<br>
Begin by lying on your back. It is easier to examine all breast tissue if you are lying down.
<br><br>

 How do I do a self-breast exam? <br>
There are a few different ways to perform a breast exam at home: <br>

 <b>1. Looking in a mirror: </b> Take off your shirt and bra and stand in front of a mirror. Put your arms down by your sides. Look for any changes in breast shape, breast swelling, dimpling in your skin or changes in the position of your nipples. Next, raise your arms high over your head and look for the same things. Finally, put your hands on your hips and press firmly to make your chest muscles flex. Look for the same changes again. Be sure to look at both breasts.
<br>
<b>2. Manual breast self-exam while standing: </b> your shirt and bra. Use your right hand to examine your left breast, then vice versa. With the pads of your three middle fingers, press on every part of one breast. Use light pressure, then medium, then firm. Feel for any lumps, thick spots or other changes. A circular pattern may help you make sure you hit every spot. Then, press the tissue nearest your armpit. Be sure to check under your areola (area around your nipple) and then squeeze your nipple to check for discharge. Repeat the steps on the other side. Many people perform a standing self-exam while in the shower.
<br>
 <b>3. Manual breast self-exam while lying down: </b> you lie down, your breast tissue spreads more evenly. This makes it a good position to feel for changes, especially if your breasts are large. Lie down and put a pillow under your right shoulder. Place your right arm behind your head. Using your left hand, apply the same technique as option 2, using the pads of your middle fingers to press all parts of your breast tissue and under your armpit. Finally, swap the pillow to the other side, and check your other breast and armpit. Be sure to check under your areola and then squeeze your nipple to check for discharge.
Keep in mind that your breast tissue extends to your armpit, collarbone and top of your abdomen. Your breast tissue isn’t just your breast cleavage and nipples.

      <li><b>	Mammograms and screenings: </b></li>

      A mammogram is an X-ray examination of the breast. It is used to detect and diagnose breast disease in women who either have breast problems, such as a lump, pain, or nipple discharge, as well as for women who have no breast complaints. The procedure allows detection of breast cancers , benign tumors, and cysts before they can be detected by palpation (touch).
      <br>
      Mammography cannot prove that an abnormal area is cancer, but if it raises a significant suspicion of cancer, tissue will be removed for a biopsy . Tissue may be removed by needle or open surgical biopsy and examined under a microscope to determine if it is cancer.
      <br>
      Mammography has been used for about 30 years, and in the past 15 years technical advancements have greatly improved both the technique and results. Today, dedicated equipment, used only for breast X-rays, produces studies that are high in quality, but low in radiation dose. Radiation risks are considered to be negligible.
      <br>
      llustration of the anatomy of the female breast, front view
      The development of digital mammography technology allows for improved breast imaging, in particular, for women less than 50 years of age, women with dense breast tissue, and women who are premenopausal or perimenopausal. Digital mammography provides electronic images of the breasts that can be enhanced by computer technology, stored on computers, and even transmitted electronically in situations where remote access to the mammogram is required. The procedure for a digital mammography is basically performed the same way as a standard mammogram.
      <br>
      With computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, a digitized mammographic image from a conventional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram is analyzed for masses, calcifications, or areas of abnormal density that may indicate the presence of cancer. The images are highlighted by the CAD system for further analysis by the radiologist.

        Breast Self-Awareness Messages: <br>
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the U.S., but it can be successfully treated. Screening tests can find cancer at an early stage, when the chances of long-term survival are highest. Regular screening tests (along with follow-up tests, if diagnosed) reduce the chance of dying from breast cancer.
<br>
 <b>1. Know your risk: </b><br>

Talk to both sides of your family to learn about your family health history. <br>
Talk to a doctor about your risk of breast cancer.<br>

<b>2. Get screened: </b>
<br>
&#8594;Talk with a doctor about which screening tests are right for you if you are at higher risk.<br>
&#8594;Have a mammogram every year starting at age 40 if you are at average risk.*<br>
&#8594; Have a clinical breast exam at least every 3 years starting at age 20, and every year starting at age 40.
* Per NCCN Guidelines 
<br><br>
 <b>3. Know what is normal for you : </b><br>

 See a doctor if you notice any of these breast changes:
<br>
&#8594;Lump, hard knot or thickening inside the breast or underarm area <br>
&#8594; Swelling, warmth, redness or darkening of the breast <br>
&#8594;Change in the size or shape of the breast<br>
&#8594;Dimpling or puckering of the skin <br>
&#8594;Itchy, scaly sore or rash on the nipple <br>
&#8594;Pulling in of your nipple or other parts of the breast <br>
&#8594;Nipple discharge that starts suddenly <br>
&#8594; New pain in one spot that doesn’t go away <br>
&#8594; To see illustrations of these warnings signs, please visit the breast cancer Warning Signs & Symptoms page. <br>

 <br> <b>4. Make healthy lifestyle choices: </b><br>

 &#8594;Maintain a healthy weight. <br>
 &#8594;Make exercise part of your routine. <br>
